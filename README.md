*PATLAB, a graphical computational software package for photoacoustic computed tomography research*

Developed by Lawson Optics Lab, Imaging Program, Lawson Health Research Institute, London, ON, Canada

Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) provides high resolution optical images of tissue at depths of up to several centimetres. This modality has been of interest to researchers for at least 30 years and is still the subject of intensive research. However, PAT researchers lack access to a comprehensive open-source graphical simulation and reconstruction software package. In this article, we introduce PATLAB, an open-source MATLAB-based graphical software package that can perform both PAT simulation and image reconstruction.  PATLAB is simple to use, yet is capable of complex PAT data processing tasks and offers advanced users a framework to build and test new methods.
